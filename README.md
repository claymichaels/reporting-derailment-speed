# reporting-derailment-speed

I wrote this after an urgent request from a customer after a train derailment. 
The question was "At what speeds do our trains take this corner", and we had no way to answer it. 
Since the data was in our telemetry database, I whipped this up to record the speed in 10mph intervals and produced a graph.
